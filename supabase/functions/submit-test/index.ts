Based on the URL and industry hint (${validatedIndustry}), determine:

1. What type of business is this? (be specific: "travel blog", "fashion marketplace", "SaaS project tool", etc.)
2. What would potential customers/users search for when looking for this type of business/service?

Generate 15 specific buyer-intent queries that someone would ask ChatGPT when looking for this type of business.

RULES:
- Queries should be natural questions buyers actually ask
- Focus on problems this business solves
- Include comparison queries (e.g. "X vs Y")
- Include recommendation queries (e.g. "best X for Y")
- Make them specific to the business type

Return ONLY valid JSON:
